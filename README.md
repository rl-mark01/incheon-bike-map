# 🚲 Incheon Industrial Complex Bike Map

## 📌 Project Overview
This project visualizes the spatial distribution of bike infrastructure around
industrial complexes in Incheon.  
The goal is to identify regional imbalances in bike accessibility and highlight
potential mobility issues faced by workers in industrial areas.

## 🗺️ Background
Incheon has several large industrial complexes where commuting convenience is a
critical issue. While bike-sharing and bike roads are expanding, their actual
coverage around industrial zones has not been evenly analyzed.

This project addresses the question:
> **Are bike facilities sufficiently distributed around industrial complexes?**

## 📊 Data & Tools
- **Data**
  - Locations of industrial complexes in Incheon
  - Bike infrastructure and bike station data
- **Tools**
  - Python
  - Folium (interactive map visualization)
  - Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Collected and preprocessed location data for industrial complexes
2. Mapped bike stations and bike paths using Folium
3. Visualized spatial concentration and gaps around industrial areas
4. Exported results as interactive HTML maps

## 📈 Key Findings
- Bike infrastructure is concentrated around central urban areas
- Several industrial complexes show limited bike accessibility
- Potential mismatch between worker density and bike facility allocation

## 🧩 Outputs
- **Interactive Map (Result)**
  - `result_mapping.html`
- **Analysis Notebook**
  - `main_code.ipynb`
- **Code-based Map Output**
  - `Industrial_Complex_bicycle_optimization_code.html`

## 💭 Implications
This analysis can support:
- Urban mobility planning
- Industrial area transportation policy
- Data-driven decision-making for bike infrastructure expansion

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Incorporate commuting population data
- Quantify accessibility with distance-based metrics
- Extend analysis to other metropolitan regions
